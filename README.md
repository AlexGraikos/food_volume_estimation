# Food volume estimation
This project aims to establish a method for image-based food volume estimation
using deep learning monocular depth estimation techniques.

## Todo
- Decide upon pose network implementation
- Run tests to verify that everything is working
- Add discriminator network (pose as conditional input?)

## Done
- Created test script for project.py
- Added smoothness loss
- Cleaned up code
- Network seems to be learning depth with lr=10^(-4)
